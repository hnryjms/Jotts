## Getting Started

Jotts is not ready for production use, but here's how you can start contributing
to Jotts.

```

### iOS

The iOS aspect of Jotts is currently the only component that is ready to build
and develop. It's written in Swift 4, and requires Xcode 9 for building.
Dependencies are handled by [Carthage][carthage] and need to be installed

The iOS app supports iOS 10.3 and later, but requirements may change as
development continues.

```
